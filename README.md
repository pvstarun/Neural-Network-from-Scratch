# Deep Learning Framework from Scratch using NumPy

A modular deep learning framework implemented entirely from scratch using **Python** and **NumPy**, without relying on deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The project demonstrates the complete implementation of the fundamental building blocks of modern deep learning, including forward propagation, backpropagation and optimization algorithms.
